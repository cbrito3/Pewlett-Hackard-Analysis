# Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database

## 1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The overview of the analysis consists in determining the number of retiring employees by title, and indentify the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program based on the criteria provided by Bobby's manager. 
Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## 2. Results
* The results determining the number of retiring employees per title show that: 
  1. There are 2 Managers
  2. There are 4502 Technical Leaders

* The reuslts of the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program show that:
  1. There are 1549 employees who qualify for this program 
  2. There are 735 employees with senior positions who qualify for this program.
