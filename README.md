# Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database

## 1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The overview of the analysis consists in determining the number of retiring employees by title, and indentify the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program based on the criteria provided by Bobby's manager. 
Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## 2. Results
* The results determining the number of retiring employees per title show that: 
  1. There are 2 Managers
  2. There are 4502 Technical Leaders

* The reuslts of the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program show that:
  1. There are 1549 employees who qualify for this program 
  2. There are 735 employees with senior positions who qualify for this program.

## 3. Summary 
Based on the results from these last two analyses Bobby's manager asked, we can conclude that there will be left many available positions due to the retirement of so many employees, the exast number being 98,395. On the other hand, there are only 1,549 employees who are elegible to mentor employees and these can count disadvantages for current employees who have to mentor a handful of employees.
